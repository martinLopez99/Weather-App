# Weather-App
This is a weather app that I created using an API and CSS. It displays the current weather conditions for a location of your choice.

This weather app was a great project for me to learn new skills in front-end web development. By implementing an API and CSS, I was able to create an app that displays the current weather conditions for a location of your choice. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. It was an excellent opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and improve my skills in web development.
